# This redirect is necessary since we accidentally set the wrong
# update URL in ABP for Android 1.2. It can be removed once we're
# not seeing anyone requesting this file anymore.
# Note that this intentionally promotes devbuilds to release builds.
# Since newer versions should use the new devbuild and release
# build update URLs requested by libadblockplus, leaving this
# redirect around won't really hurt.
