# Sets the default number of rounds used when encoding passwords
# using the PBKDF2 scheme. Set this to a higher value on faster
# systems which want more security.
# PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function) is a
# password hashing mechanism that derives hash from the
# password and a random salt. For authentication this process
# is repeated with the same salt as in the stored hash.
# If both hashes match, the authentication succeeds.
# PBKDF2 supports a variable 'rounds' parameter which varies
# the time-cost of calculating the hash - doubling the number
# of rounds doubles the cpu time required to calculate it. The
# purpose of this is to periodically adjust the rounds as CPUs
# become faster. The currently enforced minimum number of
# rounds is 1000.
# See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2 and RFC2898
